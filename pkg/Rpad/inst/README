app.profile.js    Application build profile for Dojo customization

--------
Parts of app.profile.js were adapted from the Dojo boilerplate:
  https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate
The Dojo sources, located in the following directories, are present on
the build machine, but are not distributed with the Rpad pacakge.
--------

src/dojo/       dojo package
src/dijit/      dijit package
src/util/       util package
dist/           The destination of the optimized JS files

--------
The Dojo build used by Rpad is compiled by running:
  src/util/buildscripts/build.sh --profile app.profile.js
Then copy the resulting dojo.js to basehtml/ for use with Rpad:
  cp dist/dojo/dojo.js basehtml/
