CHANGES IN Rpad 1.3.99.2 (2014-01-04)
-------------------------------------

- Restore Perl files related to server version of Rpad
  (Rpad_process.pl, R_process.pl).

- Rename LocalDefault.Rpad to index.html (used in both the local and
  server versions).

- Remove outdated Debian and Windows sections in ServerNotes.html, but
  move some of the notes to "Additional Notes".

- Major revision of R_process.pl. Now uses a recent Statistics::R
  (tested with version 0.32), forks a background Perl process,
  uses Linux:Inotify to become aware of R commands, and attempts to
  to self-destruct after 10 minutes.

CHANGES IN Rpad 1.3.99.0 (2013-12-31)
-------------------------------------

CHANGES IN R CODE:

- Replace defunct '.find.package' with 'find.package'.

- Remove 'is.nan' call in data.frame method of Html(), which gives
  the error "default method not implemented for type 'list'".

- Make BR into a function.

CHANGES IN JAVASCRIPT CODE:

- Upgrade Dojo from 1.8.3 to 1.9.2.

- Add app.profile.js and instructions (in README) for building
  customized dojo.js layer for distribution with Rpad.

- Rpad_body.js now makes more use of Dojo AMD modules, but still uses
  global variables for DOM traversal and calculation logic.

- Widgets containing HTML input elements are interpreted
  as variable assignments.

- Interpretation of 'rpadType' attribute is now limited to input
  elements outside of widgets, and is mandatory for those input
  elements to be calculated. All Rpad widgets containing HTML textarea
  elements are interpreted as R commands; saving input to a file is no
  longer supported.

- Keyboard shortcut F9 (Calculate Page) re-implemented; other function
  keys dropped.

DOCUMENTATION:

- Add DojoTest.html and RpadTest.Rpad.

- Reconfigure InputExamples.Rpad to show three types of construction
  (HTML markup, markup with Rpad widgets, generation in R code).

PACKAGE MAINTENANCE:

- Remove debian directory (configuration for Debian packaging).

- Remove localversion directory (scripts for launching Rpad locally).

- Remove basehtml/js directory (syntax highlighting, R help search).

- Remove basehtml/editor directory (GUI for building Rpad pages).

- Remove some help/example pages that are no longer supported:
  SearchRKeywords.Rpad, UpdateRKeywords.Rpad, GuiExamples.Rpad

- Remove asFilteringTable() and filteringtable CSS code. May be
  possible later to re-implement this in Dojo 1.9:
  https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.9/dojox/grid/example_Filtering_data.html

- Initial import to R-Forge.


CHANGES IN Rpad 1.3.1 (2013-01-07, unreleased)
----------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:

- This package was modified from the latest Rpad package archived on
  CRAN (version 1.3.0, dated 2007-04-24). Changes were made to re-create
  a working package and to pass R CMD check.

- Not every function has been tested recently. The following should work:

  - Base page started with Rpad()

  - "localversion"

CHANGES TO RESTORE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS:

- In guiSource(), change .Internal(eval.with.vis()) to
  withVisible(eval()).
  (R 3.0.0: "The .Internal(eval.with.vis) non-API function has been removed.")

- Add an explicit return(str) to HTMLargs(). The implicit return of the for()
  loop became NULL in R 2.10.0, casusing .R and .html files to not appear
  as links on the Rpad base page.
  (R 2.10.0: "for(), while(), and repeat() loops now always return NULL
    as their (invisible) value.")

CHANGES FOR R CMD check:

- Remove require("graphics") and require("utils") in .onLoad() .
  ("Package startup functions should not change the search path.")

- Protect require(GDD) with \donttest{} in RpadGraphing.Rd .
  ("'library' or 'require' call not declared from: 'GDD'")

- In processRpadCommands(), access textConnection result using get() .
  ("no visible binding for global variable 'textfromconnection'")

- In newDevice(), change call to png() .
  ("partial argument match of 'file' to 'filename'")

- Rename hidden file inst/basehtml/.RpadStartup.R to RpadStartup.R .

- Remove hidden file inst/localversion/.Rprofile . 

CHANGES IN JAVASCRIPT (Dojo):

- upgrade Dojo from 0.4.1 to 1.8.3

- major changes to Rpad_main.js

  - change dojo.provide to define

  - change dojo.event.connect to dojo.connect

  - change syntax in definition of Rpad widget

    - method fillInTemplate -> postCreate

  - change dojoType to data-dojo-type

  - change dojo.io.bind to dojo.xhr

  - change dojo.onkey to dojo.onkeypress

  - use domReady! (AMD API) instead of dojo.connect to start rpad.init

  - template: change dojoAttachPoint to data-dojo-attach-point  

  - key F11 removed (djConfig.isDebug)

  - get widget instance with dijit.byNode() instead of dojo.widget.getWidgetsByFilter()

  - change widget method fillInTemplate to postCreate
