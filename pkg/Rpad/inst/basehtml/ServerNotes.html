      <h2>Installation of the Server Version</h2>

      <p>This document outlines the setup of the server version of Rpad on Linux using Apache 2.4.
      The Perl portion of the Rpad interface can be installed using CGI or mod_perl.</p>

      <p>The main steps to installing Rpad on a server are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Install R.</li>

        <li>Install the R2HTML package from CRAN.</li>

        <li>Install the Rpad package from CRAN.
        Note: for server version, Rpad and all other referenced R packages must be
        installed at the system level.</li>

        <li>Install Apache.</li>

        <li>Install mod_perl (optional, but faster than CGI). </li>

        <li>Copy the directory basehtml in Rpad's package directory to
        /var/www (or wherever your server root is). Rename as
        appropriate. For example: </li>
<pre>
cp -r /usr/lib/R/library/Rpad/basehtml /var/www/Rpad
</pre>

        <li>Ensure the webserver user (e.g. apache) has write access to the /tmp directory.</li>

        <li>Enable execution of all of the Rpad/server/*.pl files
        (chmod a+x).</li>

        
        <li>Install the required Perl modules (all available on CPAN):</li>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Statistics::R (tested with version 0.32; don't use the old 0.02!) (and dependencies IPC::Run, Regexp::Common, Text::Balanced).
        Used to control an R process through Perl.</li>

        <li>Linux::Inotify2 (and its dependency, common:sense). Used to monitor file changes
        so that incoming R commands can be executed by a backgrounded Perl/R bridge.</li>

        <li>Time::Out. Used to time out waiting for R results (10 seconds), and to destroy the background
        Perl/R bridge (10 minutes, after which the temporary directory is cleared and the R and Perl processes exit).</li>
        </ul>

        
        </li>

        <li>Update the HTTP server configuration file to enable execution of the Perl scripts.
        Also, add a mime type to tell the server to serve .Rpad files as text/html, and
        use mod_expires to tell the browser not to cache some files which might change
        during a session. Here is the portion of the httpd.conf for Apache 2.4
        to do this using CGI:</li>

      </ul>

<pre>
LoadModule cgi_module modules/mod_cgi.so
&lt;Directory /var/www/Rpad/server*>  
  Options +ExecCGI
  AddHandler cgi-script .pl
  &lt;IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresDefault "now plus 0 seconds"
  &lt;/IfModule>
&lt;/Directory>
AddType text/html .Rpad
</pre>

      <ul>
        <li>This is what it might look like when using mod_perl:</li>
      </ul>

<pre>
LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so
&lt;Directory /var/www/Rpad/server*>  
  &lt;IfModule mod_perl.c>
    &lt;Files *.pl> # requires mod_perl
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
      PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
      Options +ExecCGI
    &lt;/Files>
  &lt;/IfModule>
  &lt;IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresDefault "now plus 0 seconds"
  &lt;/IfModule>
&lt;/Directory>
AddType text/html .Rpad
</pre>


      <h2>Additional Notes</h2>

<p>I normally add a cron job to restart the Apache server once a
day. This clears out any R processes that didn't get killed for
whatever reason. I create the following as the file /etc/cron.daily/Rpad-cleanup:</p>

<pre>
   apachectl restart
   rm -rf /var/www/Rpad/server/dd*
</pre>

<p>Some considerations for Windows:</p>

<pre>
# Used R's png driver rather than ghostscript: in RpadStartup.R,
# uncommented the following line: 
# 
graphoptions(type="Rpng")

That was it. I had ghostscript installed, so the default 
graphoptions(type="pngalpha")
also worked.

On my system, a number of stranded Rterm.exe files built
up. Restarting apache didn't get rid of them. The task manager
wouldn't get rid of them either. So, I used the "process"
command downloaded from
http://www.beyondlogic.org/solutions/processutil/processutil.htm
to kill them as:
process -k Rterm.exe

You also probably need to lock down the file system. Apache
starting as a service has access to the whole file system.
You need to change the user for the apache service and 
set permissions for that user to prevent access to unwanted
parts of your hard drive. Google for "apache localsystem ntfs permissions".
</pre> 



      <h2>Troubleshouting server installations</h2>

<p>Look for directories named /var/www/Rpad/server/dd??????????/
(adjust as needed for your root directory). In those
directories, do you see eps and png graphics files? Having the eps files
but not the png files might indicate that ghostscript isn't working
right. If the directories are not being created it indicates that the
perl interface is not working right.</p>

<p>If Rpad code sections return something like the following in your browser, then
perl or mod_perl is not set up right:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
&lt;HTML>&lt;HEAD>
&lt;TITLE>405 Method Not Allowed&lt;/TITLE>
&lt;/HEAD>&lt;BODY>
&lt;H1>Method Not Allowed&lt;/H1>
The requested method POST is not allowed for the URL /Rpad/server/R_process.pl.&lt;P>
&lt;HR>
&lt;ADDRESS>Apache/1.3.33 Server at tomshort Port 80&lt;/ADDRESS>
&lt;/BODY>&lt;/HTML> 
</pre>


<p>In 'General Example', do you see the HTML table just below the
"HTML(head(dataset))" line? If so, that suggests that R2HTML is installed
correctly.</p>

<p>In an Rpad page, select an R input section. On the first line of one of
these, insert "RpadURL()" and hit the calculate button or F9. It
should come back with something like "/Rpad/server/ddNgkIdEnXNA". Does it?
If it's pointing to the wrong place, the browser won't be able to find the
graphics files. If this happened, the browser would be blank where the
graphic was supposed to be. </p>

<p>Make sure the *.pl files in /var/www/Rpad/server/ are set to enable
execution.</p>

<p>Check the apache (or other server) error logs for additional information
(/var/log/apache/error.log on Debian).</p> 

<p>To test out the perl portion of Rpad and the browser access, enter the following in your browser:</p>

<p>http://localhost/Rpad/server/Rpad_process.pl?command=login</p>

<p>This should return a directory name, something like ddqbwuyLueIL. This should make a directory of the same name in Rpad/server. Then take this directory name and make another url as follows (replace the ID=ddqbwuyLueIL with your actual directory name):</p>

<p>http://localhost/Rpad/server/R_process.pl?&ID=ddqbwuyLueIL&command=R_commands&R_commands=print('hello' <http://localhost/Rpad/server/R_process.pl?&ID=ddqbwuyLueIL&command=R_commands&R_commands=print%28%27hello%27>)</p>

<p>This should return [1] "hello" to the browser. If that works, then your connection to R should be right. </p>

<p>If graphics appear locally but not on remote machines, it indicates
a problem with finding the URL for the graphics files. You may have to
modify the Rpad/RpadStartup.R to explicitly tell R where to find
the graphics files, like:</p>
assign("RpadDir", envir = Rpad:::.RpadEnv,
       gsub("c:/Inetpub/wwwroot","", getwd(), ignore.case = TRUE) )
